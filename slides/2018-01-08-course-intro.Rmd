# Light is transmitted, absorbed, or reflected from surfaces

<img src="http://maggiesscienceconnection.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/0/5/5105330/749786187.gif?496"/>

Surface properties (geometry, materials) affect.

Monochromatic (white, gray, black) surfaces reflect/absorb all visible wavelengths equally.

# Light can be refracted in transmission

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eejRR.gif"/>

Why? Light doesn't always go 186K miles (300 km)/s. Speed a function of wavelength and the propagating material.

# Discussion of Barlow 1972

# What question is Barlow trying to answer?

>*"I shall discuss the difficult but challenging problem of the relation between our subjective perceptions and the activity of the nerve cells in our brains..."*

---
class: center, middle

>*"...[Müller's doctrine of specific nerve energies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_specific_nerve_energies): the specificity of different sensations stems from the responsiveness of different nerve fibres to different types of stimulus..."*

>*"...sensory nerves usually adapt to a constant stimulus, and therefore signal sudden changes of stimulus energy better than sustained levels..."*

---
class: center, middle

>*"...if the surrounding region is simultaneously stimulated the response of the cell is diminished or completely abolished (Barlow, 1953). This phenomenon is called lateral inhibition, or peripheral suppression, and such a physiological mechanism had already been postulated in order to account for simultaneous brightness and Mach bands (Mach, 1886; Fry, 1948). Thus the physiological experiment was really providing evidence in support of a psychological hypothesis..."*

>*"two important concepts from the frog's retina: it transmits a map, not of the light intensities at each point of the image, but of the trigger features in the world before the eye, and its main function is not to transduce different luminance levels into different impulse frequencies, but to continue responding invariantly to the same external patterns despite changes of average luminance."*

---
class: center, middle

>*"In the cortex Hubel and Wiesel (1962) found that some of the higher level neurons responded to the same trigger feature over a considerable range of positions. The modality specificity of peripheral neurons indicates how one can, for instance, detect warmth at any point on the body surface, and we now see that the organized pattern specificity of a set of cortical neurons can in the same way produce positional invariance for pattern perception."*

---
class: center, middle

>*"If sensory messages are to be given a prominence proportional to their informational value, mechanisms must exist for reducing the magnitude of representation of patterns which are constantly present, and this is presumably the underlying rationale for adaptive effects"*

---
class: center, middle

>*"Individual nerve cells were formerly thought to be unreliable, idiosyncratic, and incapable of performing complex tasks without acting in concert and thus overcoming their individual errors. This was quite wrong, and we now realise their apparently erratic behaviour was caused by our ignorance, not the neuron's incompetence."*

---
class: center, middle

>*"...a prime function of sensory centres is to code efficiently the patterns of excitation that occur, thus developing a less redundant representation of the environment."*

# Barlow's Five Dogmas

1. To understand nervous function one needs to look at interactions at a cellular level, rather than either a more macroscopic or microscopic level, because behaviour depends upon the organized pattern of these intercellular interactions.
2. The sensory system is organized to achieve as complete a representation of the sensory stimulus as possible with the minimum number of active neurons.
3. Trigger features of sensory neurons are matched to redundant patterns of stimulation by experience as well as by developmental processes.
4. Perception corresponds to the activity of a small selection from the very numerous high-level neurons, each of which corresponds to a pattern of external events of the order of complexity of the events symbolized by a word.
5. High impulse frequency in such neurons corresponds to high certainty that the trigger feature is present.
