## About

The first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying behavior, especially perception. 
In this course, we will explore some of the major topics in the field of [vision science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_science).
Vision science incorporates ideas and methods from computer science, engineering, physics, and biology, and has implications for virtually every area of psychological science.
