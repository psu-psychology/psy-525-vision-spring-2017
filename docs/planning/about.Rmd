The first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying the brain, especially perception. 
In this course, we will explore some of the major topics in the field of vision science.
Vision science incorporates ideas and methods from computer science, engineering, physics, and biology, and has implications for virtually every area of psychological science.

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate or graduate coursework in sensation and perception, neuroscience, or physiological psychology are helpful, but not required.
